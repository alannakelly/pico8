# Score - score.p8

Demonstrates using the long addition method to use arbitary precision integers in PICO-8. This can be used to calculate game scores greater than 32767. 

While there are other methods of implementing similar mathematics in PICO-8 that may or may not be faster, they are all more complex to implement and understand. I believe this is the simplest solution that takes advantage of the PICO-8 Lua dialect.
