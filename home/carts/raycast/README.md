# Raycaster

Example of making a raycaster in pico-8, demonstrating how the illusion of a 3d world can be easily created using simple trigonometry. This is essentially the same basic technique that  classic games like wolfenstien 3d and DOOM used. There are lots of ways to optimise, improve or build on this basic shell. This example is meant to show the basic idea.
