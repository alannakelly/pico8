# PICO-8 Examples

A set of examples using Lexaloffe's [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

## score.p8

Demonstrates a simple method of calculating and displaying arbitary precision integers in PICO-8, which can be used for game scores greater than 32767. While there are other methods of implementing similar mathematics in PICO-8 that may or may not be faster, they are all more complex to implement and understand. I believe this is the simplest solution that takes advantage of the PICO-8 Lua dialect.
